# .NET Data Access - Workshop

Today we will use .NET to build a scalable API that can read, write, update, and delete data from a database as well as much more. We will show you how to debug your code, measure how your application is doing, and write tests for your project. Finally, we set up our data access for real world scenarios such as type conversions and data seeding.

This workshop is hands on and designed to be completed in a day. It can be worked through differently depending on your learning style - think of it like a choose-your-own-adventure book.

If you are new to data access and/or only need basic CRUD operations, I recommend going through _ that will guide you through building a simple GraphQL or REST API without any code by using the Data API Builder command-line interface. This workshop will focus on writing APIs using Entity Framework Core that can scale over time and be used in complex real world scenarios.
